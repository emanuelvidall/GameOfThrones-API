# GameOfThrones-API
## About The Project âš”

As we started a new course on Software Development, me and [Rafael Saboia](https://github.com/rafaelsaboia) came up with the idea of making
a website that should make calls to an API, to further develop our HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT skills. In this case, we've choosen the Game of Thrones API, where
we should type the name of a character and, after calling the api, return its characteristics and image to the user.
